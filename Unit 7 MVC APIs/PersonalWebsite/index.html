    <h1>Welcome to my Personal Website</h1>
    <p style="width: 50%; margin: auto">
      Before I got into programming, I was in highschool. During highschool I
      knew exactly what I wanted to do going into college. I went into college
      and studied Computer Programming.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p style="width: 50%; margin: auto">
      During college I took multiple classes on programming with different
      languages. They all ended their classes around OOP. As I was finishing my
      college, a friend from Grand Circus reached out and asked me to be a TA.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p style="width: 50%; margin: auto">
      I, of course, accepted. What I didn't realize was that I would have to
      learn a new framework on the job all while in college still. Since then I
      have been with Grand Circus on and off. I am currently with them as a C#
      Instructor.
